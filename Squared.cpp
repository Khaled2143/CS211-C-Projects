    /*
Square numbers end with 0, 1, 4, 5, 6 or 9 at the unitâ€™s place
If a number ends with 1 or 9, then its square will always end with 1
If a number ends with 4 or 6, then its square will always end with 6
Unit digit of square of any number will be the unit digit of square of its last digit
The square root of perfect square is always a natural number
The perfect squares will end with even numbers of zeros
Square of even numbers are always even
Square of odd numbers are always odd
